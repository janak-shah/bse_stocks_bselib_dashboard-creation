# bse_stocks_bselib_dashboard-creation
This repository has python programs which enables a user to study the BSELIB module which is essentially an API that queries the BSE website and screener.in website.
The user can take the data, clean it and store it in their local sqlite db. 
The user can also create their own dashboards  based on their desired criteria for stock selection. All of this has been covered in the python files.
